## App Purpose

I made this to show kids at a career fair I attended as a simple program that a single person can make with buttons and effects.

## Presentation

[KidsCareerFair.pptx](SoftwareDeveloper_ElementaryCareerFair.pptx)

This presentation goes through a career as a software developer.

## Implementation
 
Shout out to https://github.com/DanielMartinus/Konfetti. This API is fun and great.

## Future improvements

With actual free time to work on this, I would add a ball game and more things to show off. Also needed is an actual code refactor.
I would also fix the display on small screens..... but designed this for a tablet on a table
